# pylib

This is a cookie cutter template for quickly setting up new LGPL python 3 libraries.

It is opinionated and doesn't offer many choices by design. It is based on [this](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)
template.

In order to use it you must first install cookiecutter, then
type:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/d-chambers/pylib
```

and fill in the requested information.
